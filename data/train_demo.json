["A film that is so much a 30\\'s Warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output, unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object. Curitz was one of the quintessential Warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality, working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at Warners, a studio that was one of the \"big five\" majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres. Even though we have a setting of the upper classes on Long Island there is the generic Warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been \"torn from the headlines\". Another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that \"They\\'re not the trophies\" gives the film a more working mans, down to earth feel, for these were the audiences that Warners were targeting in the great depression. ( ironically Columbia and Universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50\\'s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent ) Curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editing. Thank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub-plot so the fun can just keep rolling along.", "Hey guys, i have been looking every where to find these two movies and i can't find them anywhere in my local area. ( I am Australian ) . Could You please help me and tell me where i can buy it from. In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies i have ever seen and are good for people of all ages. It was my favourite movie wen i was 5 and it still is even now when i am a teenager. It is a great movie for the whole family. My entire family loves this movie except for my younger sister because i have watched it that many times that she is sick of it. I love this movie and i cant wait till i can buy it again on DVD. Sally", "I have complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same then it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life!! Just go onto the official site and the rest is simple enough. I do not understand why this show has been cancelled. What a fantastic show, cast and characters. The whole concept is gripping viewing! I am astounded that my favourite show is over after just one series. Why is this? Six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than so many other TV programmes out there! Until I heard they were stopping it from a friend it hadn't even occurred to me that this might happen.", "Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for last! I've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say to that is...are you kidding me? Come on it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie I really didn't even notice it. You can tell that Damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in this case its a really good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon also has a great supporting cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization. Even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on. This film stands far above the other two Bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!", "People forget that there have been several King Kong ripoffs- Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong ( 1976 ) , they all ripoff one another, but YETI stands on its own. It only borrows one element from King Kong and that is the animal\\'s attraction with one female. The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot ( not like King Kong ) and archeologists have been fascinated it, at one time they did exist,but there is no scientific data to prove it. This movie is hard to find ,but its worth watching it. The first time I watched it was on \"Elvira\\'s Mistress of the Dark Shows\" in the early 1980\\'s. It sent chills down my spine as a kid, especially when the YETI got mad. I saw it again, around 1:00am on ABC about 2 to 3yrs ago. Seeing it again made me appreciate it more, it has some overall good effects ( for its time ) and the story involves a mute boy and his dog, and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the YETI for his own purposes. Also the music is pretty cool,its very YETI like. :- ) Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere. Vote 7 and half out of 10."]
